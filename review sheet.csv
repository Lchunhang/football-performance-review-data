Transition to attack in elite soccer,Mike Hughes & Trevor Lovell,2019,"This study examines the transition from defense to attack, emphasizing key areas and types of turnovers, and specific player actions that enhance scoring opportunities, and therefore their performance.

[2] Tackles were identified as the most effective turnover type, leading to more scoring opportunities and goals than interceptions. By weighting turnovers based on field zones (e.g., defensive vs. offensive zones), the effectiveness of a player's transition contributions can be evaluated. Offensive-zone turnovers, which yield higher scoring potential, would increase a player’s rating for impactful play, particularly for forwards or aggressive midfielders involved in pressing. [3] Immediate forward passes, dribbles, or runs after a turnover significantly increase the probability of a successful scoring opportunity. Player ratings can be enhanced by incorporating post-turnover decisions, such as forward passes, runs, and dribbles.","[1] Analysis confined to the Champions League knockout stages limits applicability to other leagues or competitive contexts.
