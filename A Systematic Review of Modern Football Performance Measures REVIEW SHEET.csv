A novel machine learning method for estimating football players value in the transfer market,Iman Behravan & Seyed Mohammad Razavi,2020,This study introduces a two-phase machine learning model to estimate football players' transfer market values using the FIFA 20 dataset.

While ELO ratings performed the best overall, PCV was slightly better than the VAEP rating system in terms of predictive performance. [2] When comparing the two methods for predicting match outcomes (bivariate Poisson and logistic regression), there was no notable difference in results. [3] One key advantage of ELO ratings was that they used more data (multiple seasons), while PCV and VAEP only used data from the 2017/18 season. This might explain why ELO ratings did slightly better overall.","[1] Players who are involved a lot, like midfielders, may have their effectiveness underestimated, while strikers who are involved less may have their effectiveness overestimated, this could mean key midfielders who are highly involved in possession are underrated compared to strikers who only touch the ball at the end of plays. [2] The system faces problems like multicollinearity (when variables are too closely related as they occur within a predefined coordinate space) and overfitting (fitting the model too perfectly to past data), which makes it harder to create a reliable model. [3] The model treats the outcome as binary (goal/no goal), which oversimplifies the game. [4] The player ratings are averaged across the team to predict match outcomes. This means that individual brilliance might get ""averaged out"" when looking at the whole teams strength, suggesting that the focus on match results might overlook the individual player performance, outside of team dynamics."
